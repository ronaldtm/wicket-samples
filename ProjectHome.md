Wicket application containing usage samples with source code.

Intended to be deployed to Google AppEngine (due the free hosting :D).


[Secondary repositories](http://code.google.com/p/wicket-samples/source/checkout?repo=wish-minimal) will contain basic examples of the WiSH architecture (Wicket+Spring+Hibernate).
They probably won't run on GAE, since they use Hibernate (and HSQLDB), but they should be useful to people, since RDBMSs rule most shops.
